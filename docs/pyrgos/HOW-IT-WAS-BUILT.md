# How Pyrgos Paseo was built

Decision log for the voice conversation agent in this fork. Ordered by build sequence; no dates.

## 1. Design note first (MIC-750 A)

- **Decided:** write `docs/pyrgos/DESIGN.md` before B (conversation agent), C (ledger and overseer feed) and D (lab speech) start, so the three can be built in parallel against fixed interfaces.
- **Who:** the overseer session set the plan; Claude drafted the note.
- **Chosen:** a direct "voice brain" hook on `VoiceSession` instead of binding voice mode to a Paseo agent. **Rejected:** the stock path (agent turn plus MCP `speak` call per reply), because it adds latency against the 2 s target.
- **Chosen:** a new `lab` speech provider id, which needs a small edit to the closed enum in `speech-types.ts`. **Rejected:** a plugin-only route, because plugins cannot register speech providers (`packages/plugin/src/server/contracts.ts`).
- **Consequence:** about three small core edits; everything else is under `pyrgos/` and `plugins/pyrgos-ledger/`.
- **Status:** verified for the cited seams (files and symbols read in this checkout). The latency claim for the stock path is **assumed**; B settles it by measuring.

## Open questions

- Is the stock bound-agent path fast enough to drop core change 2? B measures time-to-first-audio.
- Does the ledger plugin need a core change to see the ledger, or is reading the shared JSONL enough?
