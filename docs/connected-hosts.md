# Connected hosts

A saved host belongs to the daemon that stores it. The app's saved connections remain a separate list.
Connect A to B in A's settings under **Hosts connected to this daemon**, through `paseo --host A host`,
or through `paseo.hosts`. Consumers select B by its learned `serverId`; management uses the stable
`registrationId` created before B is reachable.

## Ownership and authority

Credentials live in A's `hosts.json`, written atomically with mode `0600` on POSIX systems. Discovery returns a safe
target description. Replacement inputs never come back through a read API. Keep this file private
when collecting diagnostics or backing up daemon state.

The authenticated producer owns its source key. Repeating an unchanged add returns the saved entry,
including a user's disabled state. Changed input requires an explicit update. Display labels and
access can be changed by users with `tunnel.manage`; connection and metadata changes require the
producer or `access.manage`. Removing a producer-managed entry allows that producer to add it again.
Disabling retains the opt-out.

Each enabled registration owns one physical daemon link, shared by status monitoring and every
routed API scope. Each scope owns an isolated virtual session on B. A derives its identity from the
admitted origin session, producer, and logical SDK scope. B admits virtual sessions under the actual
physical link principal, then intersects forwarded caller grants with that link's current authority.
Changing or resuming a parent's grants closes its existing channels; reconnect re-admits demand with
current authority. A routed API cannot select a second hop, and saving a host grants no reverse access.

A producer that registers a host through a routed API is qualified on B as
`route:<B principal>:<A serverId>:<A producer>`, with each component percent-encoded. This namespace belongs to the authenticated link
principal. An ordinary direct B consumer does not become that producer by supplying a source key.
The optional `server_info.sourceId` reports this producer identity for source-owner controls; it does not describe the authenticated admission principal.
Trusted server plugins retain the authority of their runtime; they are not sandboxed by this feature.

## Connections and recovery

The shared Node connector owns the target grammar and each connection attempt, including a fresh
SSH process. SSH reaches an already running daemon. The shared client connection lifecycle owns
physical reconnect and keepalive; the registry retains configuration, identity acceptance, and recovery
status. Unreachable registrations remain saved. Identity is pinned when discovered. Self and duplicate
registrations remain inspectable; a changed destination requires explicit identity replacement.

Both daemons advertise `connectedHosts`; the shared link additionally requires `hostMultiplexing`.
A completes capability and pinned-identity checks on each physical recovery before admitting channels. There is no local fallback. An older daemon continues to serve existing local
operations; requesting this feature gives update guidance.

Disposing a routed API releases its observations and session. It does not remove the saved host or
affect sibling API scopes. Disposing the origin cascades to its derived scopes. Observations restore
through the usual owned-subscription contract; requests made while offline fail. Losing a response
returns `outcome_unknown` with the destination ID. Inspect the destination before retrying a mutation.
No mutation is automatically replayed.

Text session envelopes carry a channel identifier. Binary routing adds an opcode, a bounded UTF-8
channel identifier, and the original terminal or file-transfer bytes. It never converts those bytes to
base64 JSON. The existing direct binary opcodes and 100 MiB message limit remain unchanged; routed
payloads reserve space for the routing header inside that limit. Relay encryption retains its own
existing frame limit.

Host links cap saved registrations, simultaneous channels, handshake lifetime, frames, physical
output, and aggregate queued bytes. Capacity checks use the actual escaped outer JSON or binary
frame size. Awaitable output completes when the physical send completes. An overflowing channel
closes without closing siblings or the saved link. Routed sessions release resources on disconnect;
subscription demand is rebuilt by its owning client on reconnect.
