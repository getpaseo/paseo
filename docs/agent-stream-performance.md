# Agent stream performance

How assistant text gets from a provider to the screen, and why it is paced on the way. Read this before changing `packages/server/src/server/agent/agent-stream-coalescer.ts`, the reducer queue in `packages/app/src/timeline/session-stream-reducers.ts`, or the reveal in `packages/app/src/hooks/use-revealed-text.ts`.

For terminal output, which is a separate pipeline with separate budgets, see [terminal-performance.md](terminal-performance.md).

## The pipeline

```
provider deltas (every provider streams incrementally)
  → AgentStreamCoalescer (daemon, leading + trailing, ≤1 message per 60ms per agent)
  → recordTimeline: one canonical row per flushed item
  → agent_stream ws message
  → reducer queue (app, one commit per frame) → session store
  → paced reveal (app, per assistant/reasoning item) → markdown blocks → paint
```

Every provider delivers incremental text, so there is no provider that needs special handling: Claude via `includePartialMessages`, Codex via `agent_message_delta`, ACP agents via `agent_message_chunk`, Pi and OMP via `text_delta`.

## Why the reveal is paced

Arrival is lumpy and there is no fixing that at the source. A 60ms coalescing window carries however many characters the model produced in those 60ms, which swings by an order of magnitude within a single turn. Painting each delta as it lands makes the size of those lumps visible, and that is what reads as jagged.

So arrival sets a _target_ and the reveal rate is derived from the backlog instead. A burst makes the text catch up faster; it does not make the text jump. Shrinking the coalescing window does not fix this — it makes the lumps smaller and more frequent, at the cost of message rate on a daemon loop that already contends with terminal frames and per-message relay encryption.

## Invariants

- **The coalescer is leading + trailing.** The first delta after an idle window flushes synchronously; only the rest of the burst waits for the trailing timer. Reverting to trailing-only adds a full window to the first character of every turn. Same shape and the same reason as `TerminalOutputCoalescer`.
- **The leading flush adds a canonical row, and that is fine.** A burst's first chunk lands as its own timeline row. `mergeAssistantChunks` / `mergeReasoningChunks` in `timeline-projection.ts` join contiguous same-turn rows, and clients read the projected timeline, so history is unaffected. Tests that assert on raw rows have to account for the extra row; tests that assert on what a client sees do not.
- **The store holds the full text; only the rendered slice is paced.** Copy, selection, the chat outline, and scroll geometry all read the same string the user can see. Pacing the store instead would leave the bottom anchor chasing a content height that is ahead of the reveal.
- **First sight of a text is revealed whole.** Only growth is paced. This is what makes history hydration, timeline replay, a virtualized row remounting on scroll, and an already-finished message all render complete on first paint without a special case for each.
- **Leaving `phase: "streaming"` snaps the reveal.** A completed turn must never be left holding characters. `layoutStream` sets the phase, so anything outside the live head with an active turn is already complete.
- **The reducer queue commits on a frame, with a timer as the ceiling.** A frame callback never fires in a hidden tab, so a timer races it and wins when nothing is painting — the store has to keep advancing either way.

## Measuring

- **Smoothness (user-perceived):** `packages/app/e2e/browser/agent-stream-smoothness.spec.ts`, gated behind `PASEO_AGENT_STREAM_PERF_E2E=1`. Drives the mock provider's `bursty-stream` model and reports coefficient of variation of characters painted per frame (smoothness) plus p95 gap between visible updates (stalls). Both numbers are needed: a stalled stream is perfectly smooth.
- **Reproducing bursty arrival:** the `bursty-stream` model in `mock-load-test-agent.ts` emits uneven runs of tokens separated by idle gaps. Burst sizes come from a seeded generator, so a run repeats exactly.
- **Rate policy in isolation:** `computeRevealStep` in `packages/app/src/agent-stream/text-reveal.ts` is pure; `text-reveal.test.ts` covers convergence and burst flattening without a renderer.

Healthy numbers (2026-08, Expo web against a local dev daemon, real Claude Haiku agent, ~8.5s samples during active streaming). Setting `TEXT_REVEAL_HORIZON_MS` to 0 makes the reveal paint on arrival, which is how the baseline column was taken:

|                                  | paint on arrival | paced |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| frames that advanced the text    | 6%               | 87%   |
| chars-per-frame CV               | 4.11             | 1.86  |
| gap between visible updates, p50 | 317ms            | 17ms  |
| gap between visible updates, p95 | 383ms            | 17ms  |

Total characters painted is roughly the same either way — the reveal changes when they land, not how many arrive.

Measure the **total** length across every `assistant-message` element, not the last one. A turn emits many assistant messages, so the tail element keeps changing identity and its length is not monotonic; sampling only the tail reads those handovers as resets and reports almost no growth. `sampleStreamFrames` does this correctly.
