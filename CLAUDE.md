# CLAUDE.md

Paseo is a mobile app for monitoring and controlling your local AI coding agents from anywhere. Your dev environment, in your pocket. Connects directly to your actual development environment — your code stays on your machine.

**Supported agents:** Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode.

## Repository map

This is an npm workspace monorepo:

- `packages/server` — Daemon: agent lifecycle, WebSocket API, MCP server
- `packages/app` — Mobile + web client (Expo)
- `packages/cli` — Docker-style CLI (`paseo run/ls/logs/wait`)
- `packages/relay` — E2E encrypted relay for remote access
- `packages/desktop` — Electron desktop wrapper
- `packages/website` — Marketing site (paseo.sh)

## Docs

`docs/` is the source of truth for system-level and process-level knowledge. **"The docs", "check the docs", or "check the X docs" always mean this directory — not the web.** Look here before fetching anything online; the docs capture gotchas and conventions you cannot derive from the code or external sources.

At the start of non-trivial work, list `docs/` and skim anything relevant to the task. When you learn something meta worth preserving — a gotcha, a convention, a workflow, a piece of system context that will outlive the current task — update an existing doc or propose a new one. Code-level facts belong in inline comments next to the code; system, process, and gotcha-level facts belong in `docs/`.

| Doc                                                            | What's in it                                                                                  |

## Quick start

```bash
npm run dev                          # Start daemon + Expo in Tmux
npm run cli -- ls -a -g              # List all agents
npm run cli -- daemon status         # Check daemon status
npm run typecheck                    # Always run after changes
npm run lint                         # Always run after changes
npm run format                       # Auto-format with Biome
npm run format:check                 # Check formatting without writing
```

## Critical rules

- **NEVER restart the main Paseo daemon on port 6767 without permission** — it manages all running agents. If you're an agent, restarting it kills your own process.
- **NEVER assume a timeout means the service needs restarting** — timeouts can be transient.
- **NEVER add auth checks to tests** — agent providers handle their own auth.
- **NEVER run the full test suite locally.** The test suites are heavy and will freeze the machine, especially if multiple agents run them in parallel. Rules:
  - Run only the specific test file you changed: `npx vitest run <file> --bail=1`
  - Never run `npm run test` for an entire workspace unless explicitly asked.
  - If you must run a broad suite, pipe output to a file and read it afterward: `npx vitest run <file> --bail=1 > /tmp/test-output.txt 2>&1` then read the file.
  - Never re-run a test suite that another agent already ran and reported green — trust the result.
  - For full suite verification, push to CI and check GitHub Actions instead.
- **Always run typecheck and lint after every change.**
- **Build workspace packages before diagnosing cross-package type errors.** This repo consumes generated declarations across workspaces. If typecheck fails in a package that depends on another workspace (especially CLI depending on server/daemon types), rebuild the owning package first so `dist` declarations are current:
  - `npm run build:daemon` — rebuild highlight, relay, server, and CLI when daemon/server/CLI types may be stale.
  - Do not patch inferred callback parameters or add local duplicate types just to silence stale declaration errors.
- **Run `npm run format` before committing.** This repo uses Biome for formatting. Do not manually fix formatting — let the formatter handle it.
- **Always use npm scripts for linting and formatting.** Do not run tools directly with `npx eslint`, `npx oxfmt`, `npx oxlint`, or package-local binaries. For targeted checks, pass file paths through the npm script:
  - `npm run lint -- packages/app/src/components/message.tsx`
  - `npm run format:files -- CLAUDE.md packages/app/src/components/message.tsx`
- **The protocol stays backward-compatible. Features don't have to.** Two separate contracts:
  - **Protocol contract (always):** schema changes must not break parsing in either direction. An old client must still parse messages from a new daemon; a new daemon must still parse messages from an old client.
    - New fields: `.optional()` with a sensible default or `.transform()` fallback.
    - Never flip optional → required, remove fields, or narrow types (`string` → `enum`, `nullable` → non-null).
    - Removed fields stay accepted (we stop sending them, not stop reading them).
    - Test with: "does a 6-month-old client still parse this?" and "does a 6-month-old daemon still send something this client accepts?"
  - **Feature contract (per-feature):** a new feature may require a new daemon capability. The client detects whether the capability is present and either runs the feature or shows "Update the host to use this." That's it.
    - **No fallback paths.** Don't write a degraded version of a new feature that runs on old daemons. Don't fan out across legacy RPCs to simulate a missing capability. The user upgrades or doesn't get the feature.
    - **No defensive branches scattered through the feature.** Capability detection happens in one place; downstream code reads a clean shape.
    - **Capability flags live in `server_info.features.*`** with a single `// COMPAT(featureName): added in v0.1.X, drop the gate when floor >= v0.1.X` comment marking the cleanup site.
    - Existing functionality keeps working across versions — that's the protocol contract doing its job. New-feature degradation is not the goal.

- **All back-compat shims are tagged and dated for cleanup.** Every shim that exists for old-client/old-daemon support carries a `COMPAT(name)` comment with the version it was added in and a target removal date (typically 6 months out). One grep — `rg "COMPAT\("` — should produce the full list of cleanup work. Don't bury back-compat in untagged `??`-fallbacks or optional-chain tunnels — that's how it stops being deletable.

## Platform gating

The app runs on iOS, Android, web (browser), and web (Electron desktop). Code is cross-platform by default. Gate only when you must. Import gates from `@/constants/platform`.

### The four gates

| Gate                       | Type      | When to use                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isWeb`                    | constant  | DOM APIs — `document`, `window`, `<div>`, `addEventListener`, `ResizeObserver`. This is the **exception**, not the default. |
| `isNative`                 | constant  | Native-only APIs — Haptics, `StatusBar.currentHeight`, push tokens, camera/scanner, `expo-av`.                              |
| `getIsElectron()`          | cached fn | Desktop wrapper features — file dialogs, titlebar drag region, daemon management, app updates, dock badges.                 |
| `useIsCompactFormFactor()` | hook      | Layout decisions — sidebar overlay vs pinned, modal vs full screen, single-panel vs split. From `@/constants/layout`.       |

### Decision matrix

| I need to...                                                   | Use                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Access DOM (`document`, `window`, `<div>`, `addEventListener`) | `if (isWeb)`                                                              |
| Use a native-only API (Haptics, push tokens, camera)           | `if (isNative)`                                                           |
| Use an Electron bridge (file dialog, titlebar, updates)        | `if (getIsElectron())`                                                    |
| Switch layout between phone and tablet/desktop                 | `useIsCompactFormFactor()`                                                |
| Show something on hover, always-visible on native              | `isHovered \|\| isNative \|\| isCompact` (hover only works on web)        |
| Gate to iOS or Android specifically                            | `Platform.OS === "ios"` / `Platform.OS === "android"` (rare, keep inline) |

### Rules

- **Default is cross-platform.** Don't gate unless you have a specific reason.
- **Prefer Metro file extensions over `if` statements.** When a module has fundamentally different implementations per platform, use `.web.ts` / `.native.ts` file extensions instead of runtime `if (isWeb)` branches. Metro resolves the correct file at build time — the unused platform code is never bundled. Reserve `if (isWeb)` for small, inline checks (a single line or a few props). If you find yourself writing a large `if (isWeb) { ... } else { ... }` block, split into separate files instead.
  ```
  hooks/
    use-audio-recorder.web.ts    ← uses Web Audio API
    use-audio-recorder.native.ts ← uses expo-audio
  ```
  Import as `@/hooks/use-audio-recorder` — Metro picks the right file automatically.
- **Use `.electron.ts` / `.electron.tsx` for Electron-only web modules.** Electron is still the Metro `web` platform, but desktop dev/build sets `PASEO_WEB_PLATFORM=electron`, so Metro first looks for `.electron.*` files and falls back to normal `.web.*` files. Use this when the implementation depends on Electron-only behavior such as `webviewTag`, desktop preload APIs, or the Electron bridge. Keep plain browser web in `.web.*`, and keep native fallbacks in the base file or `.native.*`.
  ```
  components/
    browser-pane.electron.tsx ← Electron <webview> implementation
    browser-pane.web.tsx      ← plain web fallback
    browser-pane.tsx          ← native fallback
  ```
  Import as `@/components/browser-pane` — Electron desktop gets the `.electron.tsx` file, browser web gets `.web.tsx`, and native gets the native/base implementation.
- **NEVER use raw DOM APIs without `isWeb` guard.** DOM APIs crash native. Casting a RN ref to `HTMLElement` is a red flag — ensure the block is web-only.
- **NEVER use `onPointerEnter`/`onPointerLeave`.** They don't fire on native iOS.
- **Hover only works on web.** React Native's `onHoverIn`/`onHoverOut` on `Pressable` does NOT fire on native iOS/iPad — the underlying W3C pointer events are behind disabled experimental flags. For hover-to-show UI (kebab menus, action buttons), use `isHovered || isNative || isCompact` so the controls are always visible on native and hover-to-show on web.
- **Don't use Platform.OS as a proxy for layout capabilities.** Use breakpoints for layout decisions, not platform checks.
- **Import `isWeb`/`isNative` from `@/constants/platform`.** Never write `const isWeb = Platform.OS === "web"` locally.
