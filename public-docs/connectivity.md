# Connectivity

Your Paseo app connects to the daemon running on your computer or server. Paseo Desktop and the CLI can tunnel through SSH. Mobile clients can connect through the Paseo relay or directly with Tailscale.

This is client-to-daemon transport. If you are looking for the service that starts agents from GitHub, Slack, and Discord events, that is [Hub](/docs/hub).

- [SSH](#ssh)
- [Paseo relay](#paseo-relay)
- [Tailscale](#tailscale)

## SSH

SSH transport connects to an existing daemon through your local OpenSSH client. It does not install, start, or configure Paseo on the remote host.

Before connecting:

1. Start the Paseo daemon on the remote host.
2. Confirm `ssh user@host` works with a key or SSH agent. Paseo uses non-interactive SSH and follows your OpenSSH config.

The CLI accepts an SSH URI as its host:

```bash
paseo ls -a --host ssh://user@host
```

The daemon is expected at `127.0.0.1:6767` on the remote host. The port in the SSH URL is the SSH server port:

```bash
paseo ls -a --host ssh://user@host:2222
```

Set a different remote daemon port with `daemonPort`:

```bash
paseo ls -a --host 'ssh://user@host?daemonPort=7777'
```

`--host` belongs after the command. `paseo daemon status` checks only the local daemon; use `paseo ls --host ...` to verify a remote connection. `paseo run --host ...` also requires `--cwd` with a path that exists on the remote host.

In Paseo Desktop, open **Settings → Add host → Remote SSH** and enter the same `ssh://` destination.

## Paseo relay

The relay works without Tailscale, port forwarding, or network configuration. Traffic is end-to-end encrypted.

Relay is disabled until you enable it.

### Enable relay from Paseo Desktop

1. Open **Settings → your host → Pair a device**.
2. Select **Enable relay**.
3. Scan the QR code with Paseo on your phone, or copy the pairing link and paste it into the phone app.

### Enable relay from the CLI

Run:

```bash
paseo daemon pair
```

Confirm when prompted. Paseo prints a QR code and pairing link. Scan the QR code with Paseo on your phone, or choose **Paste pairing link** in the phone app.

## Tailscale

Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) on the daemon machine and your phone. Sign in to the same tailnet on both devices.

### 1. Find the daemon machine's Tailscale IP

Run this on the daemon machine:

```bash
tailscale ip -4
```

Copy the address it prints. The example below uses `100.101.102.103`.

### 2. Configure the daemon

Open `~/.paseo/config.json` and set `daemon.listen` to the Tailscale IP:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://paseo.sh/schemas/paseo.config.v1.json",
  "version": 1,
  "daemon": {
    "listen": "100.101.102.103:6767"
  }
}
```

Keep the other settings already in the file. If it has a `daemon` object, add `listen` inside that object.

To restrict access with a password, see [Password authentication](/docs/configuration#password-authentication).

Restart the daemon:

```bash
paseo daemon restart
```

If Paseo Desktop manages the daemon, use **Settings → your host → Overview → Restart daemon**.

### 3. Connect the phone app

1. Connect Tailscale on your phone.
2. Open Paseo and go to **Settings → Add host → Direct connection**.
3. Enter the Tailscale IP in **Host**.
4. Enter `6767` in **Port**.
5. Leave **Use SSL** off and select **Connect**.

If the host was already paired through the relay, Paseo adds the direct connection to the same host.

## Troubleshooting

- **SSH authentication failed:** Run `ssh user@host` in a terminal and fix the key, agent, host key, or `~/.ssh/config` entry there. Paseo does not prompt for SSH passwords.
- **SSH connects but Paseo is refused:** Run `paseo daemon status` on the remote host. SSH transport does not start the daemon.
- **Connection timed out:** Check that Tailscale is connected on both devices and that you used the daemon machine's Tailscale IP.
- **Connection refused:** Run `paseo daemon status` and confirm the daemon is running on the configured IP and port.
- **Config change has no effect:** Run `paseo reload`. `daemon.listen` is a startup setting, so restart when the command reports it.
