Let's improve the board creation and updates. I'm going to give you a couple of improvements I want to do there. So we have an edit board definition and a create board definition dialogues. And so first of all, a simple low-hanging fruit is when you edit definition, the button says save. Let's call this update board. And what this will do is it will update definition as it does now. And if, this is important, only if the prompt changes, okay, this is important, only if the prompt changes or the scope changes, basically if rendering the board would yield a different board, then at the same time we'll also call generate refresh board at the same time so that we can, yeah, the user can see their changes right away. Then I would say even for the edit board dialogue, we could do that the save button maybe is disabled until you make a change that would affect it. So the user has to click cancel if they actually don't change anything. So save or update board would only be enabled if we update the details.
