 * Compact gets both, on their own line under the workspace name: this header is the only thing on
 * screen that says where the workspace lives, because the sidebar that normally carries the host
 * badge is closed. It still follows the host's own badge setting, so a purely local setup stays
 * quiet. A project name that only repeats the workspace name is dropped on wide, where the two sit
 * side by side, and kept on compact, where the line exists for the host anyway.
