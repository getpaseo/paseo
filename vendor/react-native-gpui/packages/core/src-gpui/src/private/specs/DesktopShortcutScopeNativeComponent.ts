/**
 * A named scope for keyboard shortcuts, as a native host component.
 *
 * Scopes nest and the innermost one wins. The precedence is resolved natively
 * by GPUI's keymap — a binding whose context names a deeper scope matches at a
 * greater depth — so this component only has to name itself and pass on what
 * fired.
 *
 * The name must end in `NativeComponent.ts`: React Native's babel plugin turns
 * any such file into a static view config, which is how core's other
 * hand-registered host components (`WindowControl`, `NativeViewHost`) work too.
 * Core has no component codegen, so the props, the descriptor and the props
 * reader are all hand-written; see
 * `ReactCxxPlatform/react/renderer/components/shortcutscope/`.
